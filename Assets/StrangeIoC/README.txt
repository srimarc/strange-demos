2.0 QUICK START

2.1 Quick start to try the examples

Create a new Unity project.

 - If you downloaded from the Unity Asset Store, import the download and uncheck the '.docs' folder.

 - If you pulled from GitHub, copy the StrangeIoC directory into your new project's Assets folder. Then delete the '.docs' folder.

In your new project, open Assets > StrangeIoC > examples > Assets > scenes > multiple contexts. Double-click on the scene 'main'.

Go to File > Build Settingsâ€¦ . Click 'Add Current'.

Open the remaining scenes, game, social and TestView (in scenes > myfirstproject). In each one, click 'Add Current' to add the scene to the project.

You can now run 'TextView' or 'main' to see how they work. Then open the solution in MonoDevelop to walk through the code.

2.2 Quick start to add StrangeIoC to your project

 - If you downloaded from the Unity Asset Store, import the download AND UNCHECK EVERYTHING EXCEPT StrangeIoC > scripts.

- If you pulled from GitHub, copy the StrangeIoC directory into your project's Assets folder. THEN DELETE EVERYTHING EXCEPT StrangeIoC > scripts.

You're good to go.
